# AI Assistant for Multimodal Capabilities

**OVERVIEW**

In today’s fast-paced data-driven world, data scientists are overwhelmed—not by lack of data, but by the time it takes to interact with it. This project is an ambitious leap toward solving that problem.

This AI Assistant is your always-on, context-aware teammate.

It doesn’t just understand numbers. It reads charts. It summarizes notebooks. It helps you code. And it grows smarter with every interaction.

**PROBLEM STATEMENT – Why This Matters**

Despite the rise of automation, the daily grind of a data scientist remains fragmented:

Switching between code, documents, dashboards, and explanations.

Struggling to collaborate across modalities: text, images, and structured data.

Losing time in repetitive tasks like cleaning, summarizing, or writing documentation.

The AI Assistant bridges this gap — it empowers data scientists to interact with their tools and data seamlessly, using natural language, visual inputs, and intelligent guidance.


**🛠️FEATURES – What the Assistant Can Do**

💬 Conversational Interface using OpenAI’s GPT-4 to answer questions, explain code, or debug errors.

📊 Multimodal Input: Upload charts, datasets, or even screenshots—the assistant understands and responds.

🧾 Notebook Summary: Reads your Jupyter notebook and summarizes it in plain English.

🧹 Code Automation: Generates boilerplate code and documentation.

🔄 Context Awareness: Remembers past queries within a session to give coherent responses.
